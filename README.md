# Movieflix

Movieflix is a web application that uses the IMDB API to display movies and tv shows for users.

# Motivation

To create a web application using the IMDB API. I was looking around on the dribble website for movie streaming design and saw a design that I really liked and wanted to take that design and build it using React.js. Also, I wanted to learn how to use TypeScript with React.js.

# Technologies

### FrontEnd

      1. React.js/TypeScript
      2. styled-components
      3. React Router
      4. axios

### BackEnd

      1. express.js - creating routes
      2. mongoose.js - Object Data Mapper (ORM) for MongoDB
      3. bcrypt.js - password hashing
      4. cookie-parser - attaching cookies to request and responses
      5. cors

### Testing

      1. jest - unit testing
      2. supertest - unit testing routes requests/responses
      3. mongodb-memory-server - in-memory version of mongo database to test models
