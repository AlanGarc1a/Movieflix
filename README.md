# Movieflix

Movieflix is a web application that uses the IMDB API to display movies and tv shows for users.

# Motivation

To create a web application using the IMDB API. I was looking around on the dribble website for movie streaming design and saw a design that I really liked and wanted to take that design and build it using React.js. Also, I wanted to learn how to use TypeScript with React.js.

# Technologies

      styled-components

### BackEnd

      express.js - creating routes
      mongoose.js - Object Data Mapper (ORM) for MongoDB
      bcrypt.js - password hashing
      cookie-parser - attaching cookies to request and responses
      cors
